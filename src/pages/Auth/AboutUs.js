                        <p>The library is at the center of the school's academic programs. The curriculum at a particular school can be largely dependent on the quality of the library. The teaching and learning process is poor without a well-equipped library.</p>
                        <p>The library is essential to facilitate student-centered learning and teaching processes like the Dalton plan, project method, and self-learning as well as seminars.</p>

                        <p>Libraries are another place for children to develop. They can assist students with the web, offer an area that is quiet for students to focus on their studies, and also encourage learners to take time to study.</p>
                        <p>Staff members, who know what books that students enjoy can assist them in choosing books that match their preferences. Sometimes, these arenâ€™t even books that the student was aware they would love. Giving students books that appeal to them can inspire students to continue reading.</p>
